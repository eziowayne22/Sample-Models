# Sample-Models
Sample Modelling performed on various datasets deploying different techniques

1. Predict the Price of an Ounce of Gold using Time Series Models

- Train models on daily gold price data going back to 1990
- Ran several different models off of testing subset
- Predicted the price of gold 3 years into the future

2. Create a wordcloud showing the Top 25 Most Frequently Used Words in The Summa Theologica Part i
- Importing the data from the gutenbergr library
- Filtering out filler/unimportant words with dplyr
- Created the final wordcloud

3. Create a classification model using logistic regression to predict whether or not a given pokemon is legendary
- train a logstic regression model using capture rate and base stats as the predictors
- ran model off of the test dataset with over 98% accuracy; base stats combined with capture rate are very predictive
