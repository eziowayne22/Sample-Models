# Sample-Models
Sample Modelling performed on various datasets deploying different techniques

1. Predict the Price of an Ounce of Gold using Time Series Models

- Train models on daily gold price data going back to 1990
- Ran several different models off of testing subset
- Predicted the price of gold 3 years into the future
